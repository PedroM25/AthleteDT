My attempt at the Swiss Timing exercise

3 strategies used for object detection:

- deep learning object detection model:
	used this pretrained model: https://www.kaggle.com/models/tensorflow/ssd-mobilenet-v2
    update 1: looks like I have to freeze it?
    update 2: tried to search how to use tensorflow directly for image analysis but seems overcomplicated
        found someone (https://stackoverflow.com/a/62245422) recomending cppflow
        maaaan
    update 3: using these: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/TensorFlow-Object-Detection-API
        have to click "Save link as" otherwise is just doesn't download????
        
     
	
	other models?
